## Steps to Run The Network Analyzer
Follow these steps to install the required dependencies and run the project locally on Windows.
### 1. Install Python 3.11

   Download Python 3.11 from the official site:
    üëâ https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

  On the installer screen, make sure to check:
    ‚úîÔ∏è ‚ÄúAdd Python 3.11 to PATH‚Äù

   Complete the installation.

To verify:

Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and run:
```bash
python --version
```

Expected output:
```bash
Python 3.11.x
```

### 2. Install Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools

Some dependencies (e.g., matplotlib) require build tools to compile.

  Download the C++ Build Tools:
    üëâ https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/

  During installation, select:
    ‚úîÔ∏è "Desktop development with C++"

  This ensures you have Visual C++ 14.0 or newer, required for building native extensions.

### 3. Install Python Dependencies

   Once Python and C++ tools are set up, run the following command:
```bash
python -m pip install scapy mac-vendor-lookup customtkinter matplotlib requests pytest hypothesis coverage --only-binary matplotlib
```
   This installs all runtime and development packages needed for the GUI, packet capture, and testing.

### 4. Run the Application
 
   Navigate to the project folder (where packet_sniffer_gui.py is located) and run:
```bash
python packet_sniffer_gui.py
```


### Optional arguments:
- `-i`, `--iface` ‚Äî Friendly name of the network interface (e.g., "Wi-Fi", "Ethernet")
- `-p`, `--pcap` ‚Äî Output file for saved packets (default: `out.pcap`)
- `-c`, `--csv` ‚Äî Output file for CSV data (default: `out.csv`)
